                    <h3>When should you use context API?</h3>
                    <p> when some data needs to be accessible by many components  context is primarily used at different nesting levels. Prop drilling occurs in situations where youâ€™re looking to get the state from the top of your react tree to the bottom and you end up passing props through components that do not necessarily need them.</p>

                    <h3>What is a custom hook?</h3>
                    <p>Custom hook is made by developer which is reuseable if different state and it start with use and also can fetch data.</p>
                </div>
                <div className='question-div-ans' >
                    <h3>What is useRef?</h3>
                    <p>useRef returns a mutable ref object where the object has a property called .current. And these values are accessed from the current property of the returned object. </p>

                    <h3>What is useMemo?</h3>
                    <p>It is a another hook in react that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders and useMemo Hook returns a memoized value. </p>
